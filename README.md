# Job Search Website

## Context
This is a website project that I built for the 2024 FBLA Website Coding and Development Competitive Event. The prompt is as follows: 

>A business has approached your team and asked you to develop a website that advertises their open positions. The website must showcase your coding and creative design skills. Your website must include the following:
>* A page including information about benefits and/or reasons to work at the company.
>* A page including at least three different job openings at the company.
>* An online job application form that allows applicants to apply for jobs at the company.

The company "MYRYA" is a fictional company within the context of this project

## Project Summary
The goal of the project was to implement AI in a way that could help job applicants not only find the right job, but also keep track of their applications to ensure they get their job. The project utilized tensorflow machine learning models and the chatGPT API to accomplish this. Here are the key features: 

* Retrieval Augmented Generation Chatbot: a chatbot that could answer questions using information directly sourced from the job database
* Recommended Jobs: a machine learning algorithm that could not only recommend jobs but also explain why they would be a good fit for the applicant
* Resume and Job Description matching: a machine learning algorithm that could scan the details within a resume and suggest points that align with a job's description
* Application Summary: a brief summary of the applicant's applications and the deadlines associated with them

## Results
The project placed first in States and qualified for Nationals
